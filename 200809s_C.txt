1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2.25 percent.
2. Incoming information suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed in recent months, partly reflecting a softening of household spending. In addition, labor markets have weakened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, some slowing in export growth, and past increases in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Nonetheless, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth.
3. Inflation has remained high, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated. Although the Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, the possibility that inflation may fail to decline as anticipated is of significant concern.
4. The Committee took this action to provide additional assurance that inflation will abate as desired. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
