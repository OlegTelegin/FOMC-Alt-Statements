>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 2-1/4 percent.
2. Recent information indicates that the outlook for economic activity has weakened further and that downside risks persist. Growth in consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to continue to weigh on economic growth.
3. Inflation has been elevated, and some measures of inflation expectations have risen. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. Todayâ€™s policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. However, the Committee judges that the downside risks to growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation. The Committee will act in a timely manner as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
