1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.
2. Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the outlook for the economy remains weak. Industrial production, housing starts, and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending. Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain tight. The Committee anticipates that a recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, supported in part by additional fiscal measures and the monetary and liquidity policies already in place.
3. The declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months have significantly reduced overall price inflation. With economic slack likely to persist, the Committee expects that both overall and core consumer price inflation will remain low.
4. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. The focus of the Committee’s policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level. The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets. Next month, the Federal Reserve will implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses. The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments.
