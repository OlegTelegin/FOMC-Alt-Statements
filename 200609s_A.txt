>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent.
2. The moderation in economic growth appears to be continuing, in part reflecting a cooling of the housing market.
3. Although core inflation remains elevated, recent readings have been slightly more favorable. While some inflation pressures persist, they seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.
4. In recent weeks, the upside risks to inflation appear to have diminished somewhat and downside risks to growth have become more significant. In these circumstances, future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
