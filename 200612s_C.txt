1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent.
2. Economic growth has slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market. The economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters.
3. Readings on core inflation have been elevated, and the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures. Inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, but the extent and speed of that moderation are uncertain. In these circumstances, the Committee believed that an additional firming of policy was appropriate to foster the achievement of price stability.
4. Although the Committee both seeks and expects a gradual reduction in inflation, it continues to view the risks to that outcome as to the upside. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
