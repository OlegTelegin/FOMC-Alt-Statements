>> Alternative B 
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent.
2. Recent indicators suggest that economic growth is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier this year.
3. Readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months. Ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs, and inflation expectations remain contained. However, the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures.
4. Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to contain inflation pressures, the Committee judges that the risks to the attainment of price stability remain tilted to the upside. The extent and timing of any further policy action will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.
5. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of sustainable economic growth and price stability.
