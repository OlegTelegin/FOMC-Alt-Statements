>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5 percent.
2. Recent indicators suggest that economic growth is moderating considerably from its quite strong pace earlier this year.
3. The Committee views the pickup in core inflation this spring as unwelcome but likely to be transitory. Ongoing productivity gains, anchored inflation expectations, and moderate economic growth should reduce inflation in coming quarters.
4. The Committee judges that the risks to the attainment of price stability remain tilted to the upside but recognizes that the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand, along with other forces, should work to contain inflation going forward. While the Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks, considerable uncertainty attends the outlook, making it prudent to await the accumulation of additional information.
