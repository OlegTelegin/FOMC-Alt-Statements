>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 4 percent.
2. Incoming information suggests that the housing correction has intensified and that growth in business and consumer spending is softening. Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks. Overall, the outlook for the economy has weakened somewhat, and downside risks to growth have increased. Todayâ€™s action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. The Committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.
