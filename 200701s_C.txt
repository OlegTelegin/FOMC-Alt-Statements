1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent.
2. Economic growth seems to be rebounding and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market. Going forward, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months but remain elevated. Inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, but the extent and speed of that moderation remain uncertain.
4. The Committee judges that inflation remains the predominant concern, and consequently that in the near term policy firming is more likely than policy easing. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
