1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5.5 percent.
2. Recent indicators suggest that economic growth is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier this year, but the level of resource utilization remains relatively high.
3. Ongoing productivity gains and contained inflation expectations should restrain inflation going forward. However, recent readings on core inflation have been elevated, which the Committee views as unwelcome.
4. In order to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth, the Committee seeks a medium-term decline in core inflation from its recent elevated levels. The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to accomplish this outcome. The extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.
