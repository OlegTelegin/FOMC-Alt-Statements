1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, apart from weather-related disruptions. Growth in employment has strengthened somewhat, and the unemployment rate, though still elevated, has declined. Private domestic demand has continued to advance, and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement. Inflation has been running close to the Committee’s longer- run objective. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects economic growth to be moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually, supported in part by the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will continue to decline at a pace that the Committee judges consistent with its mandate. However, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run near its 2 percent objective.
3. In light of the improving economic outlook, the Committee judges that it has provided sufficient policy accommodation to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its mandate. Accordingly, the Committee will, at the end of the year, discontinue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities and complete its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities. The Committee is continuing its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and, in January, will resume rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. These actions, which together will keep the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at a level of about $2.8 trillion, will maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy and should sustain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to keep broader financial conditions accommodative.
4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and is prepared to take further action as needed to promote sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability. 
5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate until it has observed substantial improvement in labor market conditions, provided that the Committee projects that inflation over the medium term will be close to its 2 percent objective and longer-term inflation expectations remain stable.
