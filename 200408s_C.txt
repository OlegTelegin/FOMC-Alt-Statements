1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1-3/4 percent.
2. The Committee continues to believe that robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity.
3. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output growth has moderated but appears poised to resume a stronger pace going forward and that labor market conditions continue to improve.
4. Although a portion of the rise in inflation this year appears to have been due to transitory factors, continuing and substantial increases in energy prices are putting persistent upward pressure on costs and overall prices.
5. In current circumstances, the Committee believes that the existing degree of policy accommodation, if sustained over the next few quarters, could foster economic growth that is more likely to be above than below its long-run sustainable pace. Similarly, with respect to the Committeeâ€™s goal of price stability, such an unchanged policy stance implies greater risks to the upside than the downside.
