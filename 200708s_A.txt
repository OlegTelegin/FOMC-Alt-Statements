>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent.
2. Overall economic activity seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. However, increased weakness in the housing sector, along with reduced availability and higher cost of credit to some households and businesses, has raised the risk that economic activity might grow less than anticipated.
3. Readings on core inflation have been relatively subdued in recent months and core inflation is expected to be moderate over coming quarters. However, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures.
4. After this action, the Committee judges that the downside risk to economic growth is roughly balanced by the upside risk to inflation. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
