1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 3 percent.
2. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.
3. Output continues to grow at a pace sufficient to eliminate any remaining resource slack.
4. While longer-term inflation expectations remain contained, pressures on inflation have intensified in recent months.
5. The Committee perceives that, if the current target for the federal funds rate were maintained for the next few quarters, it is more likely than not that output would grow at a pace faster than is sustainable and that inflation pressures would pick up.
6. However, the pace at which policy accommodation will be removed to contain those risks will depend on economic prospects.
