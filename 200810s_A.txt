>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent.
2. The outlook for economic activity has weakened, and downside risks to growth appear to have increased. Consumer spending and industrial production have declined in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for U.S. exports. Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.
3. In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability.
4. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
