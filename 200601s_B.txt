>> Alternative B
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent.
2. Smoothing through near-term volatility in spending and production, the expansion in economic activity appears solid.
3. Core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. Nevertheless, possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures.
4. The Committee judges that some further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.
5. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.
