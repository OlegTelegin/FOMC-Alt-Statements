>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3-1/4 percent.
2. The Committee believes that the degree of monetary policy accommodation has been substantially reduced. Robust underlying growth in productivity continues to provide support to economic activity.
3. Nonetheless, growth in spending slowed somewhat in the spring, partly in response to elevated energy prices. Labor market conditions, however, apparently continue to improve gradually.
4. Readings on inflation have been subdued in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations have declined.
5. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.
6. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that remaining policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
