1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that a recovery in economic activity is under way. Conditions in financial markets were roughly unchanged, on balance, over the intermeeting period, and activity in the housing sector has increased over recent months. Household spending appears to be expanding. Businesses have made additional progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. The Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth in a context of price stability.
2. Longer-term inflation expectations have been stable, and the Committee expects that, with appropriate monetary policy adjustments, inflation will remain at levels consistent with price stability.
3. At this meeting, the Committee maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at its exceptionally low level of 0 to 0.25 percent, and it anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. In view of continued improvements in financial market conditions and the economic outlook, the Committee decided to cap its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities at $1.1 trillion and its purchases of agency debt at $160 billion. The Committee will gradually slow the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipates that they will be executed by the end of January 2010. The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.
