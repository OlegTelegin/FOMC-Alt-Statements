1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent.
2. Although some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market, weakness in residential construction remains a drag on economic growth. Nevertheless, supported in part by recent gains in incomes and declines in energy prices, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months, and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time. However, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures.
4. The Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
