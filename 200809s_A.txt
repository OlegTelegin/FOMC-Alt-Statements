>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent.
2. Incoming information suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed in recent months, partly reflecting a softening of household spending. In addition, labor markets have weakened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, some slowing in export growth, and past increases in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth.
3. Inflation has been high, but the Committee expects that the recent decline in energy and other commodity prices and increased slack in resource utilization will foster a moderation of inflation later this year and next year. Nevertheless, the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.
4. The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern to the Committee. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
