>> Alternative A 
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep raise its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25 percent.
2. Smoothing through near-term volatility in spending and production, the expansion in economic activity appears solid.
3. While possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures, core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months. Moreover, longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.
4. The Committee judges that some further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.
5. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.
