1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5-1/4 percent.
2. Economic growth rebounded to nearly a 5 percent annual rate in the first quarter. The Committee sees growth as likely to moderate somewhat in coming quarters, though data confirming a slowing in growth have been sparse.
3. As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, and ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check. However, the recent climb in energy and other commodity prices, an apparent rise in inflation expectations, and possible increases in resource utilization have the potential to add to inflation pressures.
4. The Committee judges that, with this action, the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability are roughly in balance.
5. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.
