1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 percent.
2. Recent information indicates that economic activity remains weak. Household and business spending has been subdued and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.
3. Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. The Committee judges that downside risks to growth remain but concluded that more time is needed to better assess economic prospects and the effects of the policy actions taken to date. The Committee will act in a timely manner as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
