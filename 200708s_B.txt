1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent.
2. Economic growth was moderate during the first half of this year. The adjustment in the housing sector is continuing, and credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses. Nonetheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.
3. Readings on core inflation have been relatively subdued in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.
4. In these circumstances, the Committeeâ€™s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
