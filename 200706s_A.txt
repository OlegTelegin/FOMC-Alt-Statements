>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent.
2. So far this year, the economy appears to have grown at a moderate pace and seems likely to continue to do so over coming quarters. But ongoing weakness in the housing sector implies a significant risk that economic activity might grow more slowly than anticipated.
3. Core inflation has edged lower in recent months and is expected to remain moderate over the next year or so. However, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to add to inflation pressures going forward.
4. With this policy action, the Committee judges that the downside risk to economic growth now roughly balances the upside risk to inflation. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
