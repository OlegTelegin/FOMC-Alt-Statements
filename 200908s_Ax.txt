1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that the pace of economic contraction has abated significantly. Conditions in financial markets have improved somewhat further in recent weeks. Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Businesses appear to have made progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales but are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing. 
2. The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. 
3. With the anticipated economic recovery likely to be weak initially and inflation expectations well-anchored, the Committee has decided to provide additional monetary stimulus by increasing its purchases of Treasury securities to $450 billion, up from the previously announced amount of as much as $300 billion. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee anticipates completing the full amounts of its purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities by year-end. The Committee will also buy up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of this year. The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Committee anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant maintaining the 0 to 0.25 percent target range for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2010.
