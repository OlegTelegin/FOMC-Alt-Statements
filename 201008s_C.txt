1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that the economic recovery is proceeding and that the labor market is improving gradually. Household spending is increasing and business spending on equipment and software continues to advance. Financial conditions have become somewhat more supportive of economic growth in recent weeks. Though underlying inflation has trended lower, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The Committee believes that a sustainable economic recovery is under way and anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. 
2. The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent and anticipates that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. The Committee will continue its approach of not reinvesting payments of principal on mortgage-backed securities and maturing agency debt held by the System Open Market Account. As a further step toward reducing the size of the Federal Reserveâ€™s balance sheet and the level of reserves in the banking system, on September 1 the Committee will stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
