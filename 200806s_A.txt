>> Alternative A 
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 1-3/4 percent.
2. Recent information indicates that economic activity has remained weak in recent months. Although consumer spending appears to have firmed somewhat, residential investment has continued to contract sharply and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.
3. Although energy prices have increased further and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months, core inflation has been stable of late. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
