>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 percent.
2. The Committee believes that the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.
3. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates a moderation in output growth and some slowing in the pace of improvement in labor market conditions.
4. Recent inflation data have been somewhat elevated, though a portion of the rise in prices evidently reflects transitory factors.
5. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal.
6. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to promote price stability and sustainable growth.
