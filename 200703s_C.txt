1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent.
2. The economy appears to be expanding at a moderate pace and likely will continue to do so in coming quarters, supported in part by solid gains in personal income and consumer spending.
3. Core inflation remains somewhat elevated. Inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, but considerable uncertainty surrounds that judgment. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures.
4. In these circumstances, the Committeeâ€™s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address this risk will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
