1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December confirms that the economic recovery is continuing. Growth in household spending has picked up and business investment is rising. Measures of underlying inflation have trended lower in recent quarters and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, but commodity prices have risen noticeably. 
2. To support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant low levels for the federal funds rate for some time. However, the Committee judges that a further expansion of its securities holdings is not necessary to support a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. Accordingly, the Committee decided today to discontinue the asset purchase program it announced in November. For the time being, the Committee will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings. 
3. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote maximum employment and price stability.
