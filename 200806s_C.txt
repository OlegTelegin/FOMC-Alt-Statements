1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2-1/4 percent.
2. Recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand, partly reflecting some firming in household spending. However, labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.
3. Overall inflation has been elevated, energy prices have continued to increase, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen further. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, partly reflecting todayâ€™s policy action. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information on the economy and financial conditions.
