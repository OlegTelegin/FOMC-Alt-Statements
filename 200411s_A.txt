2. The Committee believes that the stance of monetary policy remains somewhat accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.
3. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions have improved modestly.
4. Despite the rise in energy prices, inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.
5. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal.
