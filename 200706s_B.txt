1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent.
2. So far this year, the economy appears to have grown at a moderate pace despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector. The economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures.
4. In these circumstances, the Committeeâ€™s predominant policy concern is the risk that the moderation in inflation will fail to be sustained. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
