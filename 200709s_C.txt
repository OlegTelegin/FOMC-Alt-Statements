1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent.
2. Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally. Today's action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year. However, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. Even after todayâ€™s action, the Committee judges that the downside risks to economic growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
