1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent.
2. Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year. Financial market conditions have deteriorated in recent weeks, leading to tighter credit and an intensification of the housing correction. These developments have the potential to restrain growth in economic activity. Nonetheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth outside the housing sector and a robust global economy.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.
4. In the current circumstances, the Committee judges that the downside risks to economic growth are now roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
