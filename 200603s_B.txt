>> Alternative B
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent
2. The slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded in the current quarter, and the underlying pace of expansion appears to be solid.
3. As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities has had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have held the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures going forward.
4. The Committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.
5. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.
