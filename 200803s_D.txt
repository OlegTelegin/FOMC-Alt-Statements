1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 3 percent.
2. Growth in consumer spending has slowed, labor markets have softened, and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Although downside risks to growth remain, recent policy actions should help to promote moderate growth over time.
3. Inflation has been elevated, and upward pressure on inflation could result from several factors, including further increases in energy, commodity, and other import prices. Although the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, the upside risks to the outlook for inflation have increased. The Committee will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to promote price stability and sustainable economic growth
