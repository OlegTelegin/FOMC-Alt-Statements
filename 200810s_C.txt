1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1.5 percent.
2. Reflecting in part the intensification of financial market turmoil, the outlook for economic activity has weakened. Consumer spending and industrial production have declined in recent months. However, policy actions taken in recent weeks, including coordinated interest rate cuts by central banks, extraordinary liquidity measures, and official steps to strengthen financial systems, should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to moderate economic growth.
3. Inflation has been high, but the Committee believes that the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity have reduced the upside risks to inflation.
4. In these circumstances, the Committeeâ€™s primary concern is the downside risks to growth. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully in light of the recent policy actions and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
