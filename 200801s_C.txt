1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 3-1/4 percent.
2. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households. Moreover, recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets.
3. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters. However, upward pressure on inflation could result from several factors, including further increases in energy, commodity, and other import prices. Therefore, it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. Todayâ€™s policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time. However, appreciable downside risks to growth remain. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.
