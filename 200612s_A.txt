>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent.
2. Economic growth has slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market. Although that adjustment is ongoing and could have a more pronounced effect on growth in coming quarters than anticipated, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly since the spring but remain elevated. The high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures. However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.
4. In these circumstances, future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
