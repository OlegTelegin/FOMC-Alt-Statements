1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-3/4 percent.
2. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.
3. Output appears to continue to be growing at a solid pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.
4. Longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, though pressures on inflation have picked up modestly in recent months. The rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through to wages or core consumer prices.
5. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.
6. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.; nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
