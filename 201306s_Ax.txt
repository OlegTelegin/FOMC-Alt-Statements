1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but manufacturing activity has slowed and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, even apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
2. In pursuing its statutory mandate, the Committee takes a balanced approach to fostering maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace, the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate, and inflation over the medium-term will move up to its 2 percent objective, or even modestly higher for a time. Nonetheless, the Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook.
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation does not remain below the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. In addition, the Committee now intends to rely upon paydowns of principal rather than sales of agency mortgage-backed securities when it eventually becomes appropriate to reduce its holdings of those securities. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.
5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 5.5 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committeeâ€™s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee eventually begins to reduce policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability. In particular, the Committee expects that when the time comes to reduce policy accommodation, it will be appropriate to do so gradually in order to foster strong growth in employment and inflation at 2 percent, or even modestly higher for a time.
