>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1-3/4 percent.
2. Recent information indicates that economic activity remains weak. Household and business spending has been subdued and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.
3. Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. The Committee judged that a further reduction in interest rates was appropriate to foster moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. The Committee will act in a timely manner as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
