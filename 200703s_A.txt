>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent
2. The economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported in part by gains in personal income and consumer spending. However, sluggish business investment and ongoing weakness in the housing sector likely will exert a drag on growth.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months, and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time. However, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures.
4. The Committee judges that the risks to growth are tilted to the downside, even after this policy action. However, upside risks to inflation remain. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
