1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have been growing at solid rates, on average, in recent quarters. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have increased from their lows last summer but have continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity and employment will expand at sustainable rates in the medium term. Inflation on a 12‐month basis is expected to move up in coming months and then to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1‐1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
