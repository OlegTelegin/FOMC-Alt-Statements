1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent.
2. Economic growth has moderated from its quite strong pace earlier this year, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market.
3. Readings on core inflation have been elevated on balance, and the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures. In these circumstances, the Committee believed that an additional firming of policy was appropriate to foster a decline in inflation.
4. Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
