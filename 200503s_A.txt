>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-3/4 percent. This action brings the cumulative increase since June 2004 to 1-3/4 percentage points.
2. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains somewhat accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.
3. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.
4. Although month-to-month movements in inflation have been volatile of late, underlying inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.
5. The Committee perceives that, if the current target for the federal funds rate were maintained for the next few quarters, it is more likely than not that output would grow at a pace faster than is sustainable and that inflation pressures would pick up.
6. However, the pace at which policy accommodation will be removed to contain those risks will depend on economic prospects.
