1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the economic recovery is proceeding. Spending by households and businesses is increasing at a moderate pace. Although measures of underlying inflation have trended lower in recent quarters, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.
2. Based on this assessment of current and prospective economic conditions, the Committee decided today to discontinue the asset-purchase program it announced in November. For the time being, the Committee will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings.
3. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant low levels for the federal funds rate for some time.
4. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote maximum employment and price stability.
