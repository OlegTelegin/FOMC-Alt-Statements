>> Alternative B
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 4-3/4 percent.
2. Economic growth was solid in the third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance. The pace of economic expansion will likely slow somewhat in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction. But, to date, other sectors of the economy have proven resilient and the global economy remains strong. The Committee anticipates that the economic expansion will return to a moderate pace over time, but sees continuing risks to growth, notably the potential impact of the tightening of credit conditions for some households and businesses.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year. However, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. On balance, the Committee views downside risks to growth as the greater policy concern. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.
