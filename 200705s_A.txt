>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent.
2. The economy seems most likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. But weakness in housing and capital spending imply a significant risk that economic activity might grow more slowly than anticipated.
3. Core inflation remains somewhat elevated on balance. Although the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures, those pressures seem likely to moderate over time.
4. In these circumstances, future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
