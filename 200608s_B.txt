1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent.
2. Economic growth has moderated from its quite strong pace earlier this year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.
3. Readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months, owing in part to the pass-through of increased energy and other commodity prices. However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.
4. Although the Committee expects inflation pressures to diminish gradually, it judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
