1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate to 1.25 percent.
2. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.
3. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid rate and hiring has picked up.
4. Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months has been due to transitory factors.
5. The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal.
6. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the Committee judges the outlook to be such that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability so as to foster maximum sustainable economic growth.
