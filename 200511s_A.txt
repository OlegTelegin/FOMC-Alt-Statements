>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged.
2. Elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity seem to have slowed the growth of spending, set back employment, and weakened consumer and business confidence. The persistence of such effects is uncertain, but robust underlying growth of productivity and monetary policy accommodation are providing support to economic activity.
3. High energy and other costs have added to inflation pressures. However, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.
4. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.
5. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that remaining policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
