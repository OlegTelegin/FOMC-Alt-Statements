1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent.
2. Despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported in part by gains in personal income and consumer spending.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months, and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time. However, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures.
4. In these circumstances, the Committeeâ€™s principal policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
