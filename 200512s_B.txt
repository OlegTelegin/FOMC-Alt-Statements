1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent.
2. Despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appears solid.
3, Core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. Nevertheless, possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures.
4. The Committee judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to both price stability and sustainable economic growth roughly in balance.
5. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability and foster sustainable economic growth.
