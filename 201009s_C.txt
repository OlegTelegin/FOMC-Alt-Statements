1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the economic recovery is proceeding. Household income and spending are increasing gradually. Manufacturing activity and business spending on equipment and software have risen. Bank lending has continued to contract, but at a reduced rate in recent months. Measures of underlying inflation have stayed subdued in recent quarters, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be modest in the near term, the Committee continues to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. 
2. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent and anticipate s that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. For the time being, the Committee also will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments to keep constant the Federal Reserveâ€™s holdings of securities at their current level. 
3. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
