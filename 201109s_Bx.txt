1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that economic growth remains slow. Recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has been increasing at only a modest pace in recent months despite some recovery in sales of motor vehicles as supply-chain disruptions eased. Investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed. However, business investment in equipment and software continues to expand. Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee continues to expect some pickup in the pace of recovery over coming quarters but anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets. The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further. However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities. The Committee is initiating purchases of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years at a pace of about $45 billion per month and will sell Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less at the same pace; the Committee anticipates continuing this maturity-extension program for up to 9 months. This program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities transactions and the overall size of the maturity extension program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee will maintain its existing policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and will reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency securities in Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years.
4. The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. 
5. The Committee will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools as appropriate.
