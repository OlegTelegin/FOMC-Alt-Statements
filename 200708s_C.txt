1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5.5 percent.
2. Economic growth picked up in the second quarter. The economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector.
3. Readings on core inflation have been relatively subdued in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Overall inflation has been elevated, boosted by increases in the prices of energy and other commodities. The high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures.
4. Even after this action, the Committeeâ€™s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
