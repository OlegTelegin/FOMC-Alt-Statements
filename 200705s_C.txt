1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5.5 percent.
2. Despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.
3. Core inflation remains somewhat elevated on balance. Inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, but considerable uncertainty surrounds that judgment. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization, in combination with the recent increases in energy and other commodity prices, has the potential to sustain those pressures.
4. Even after this action, the Committeeâ€™s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
