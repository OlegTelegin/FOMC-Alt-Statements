1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 3-1/2 percent.
2. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit and the deepening of the housing contraction could weigh further on economic growth. However, recent policy actions should promote moderate growth over time.
3. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters. However, upward pressure on inflation could result from several factors, including further increases in energy, commodity, and other import prices. Therefore, it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. Appreciable downside risks to growth remain. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.
