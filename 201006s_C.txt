1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market has continued to improve. Household spending is increasing, and business spending on equipment and software is rising at a robust pace. Underlying inflation has trended lower, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Although financial market conditions have become somewhat less supportive of growth on balance in recent weeks, the Committee believes that a sustainable economic recovery is under way and anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization with subdued rates of inflation.
2. The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent and anticipates that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. As a step toward normalizing the size of the Federal Reserveâ€™s balance sheet and the level of reserves in the banking system, on August 3 the Committee will stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities; the Committee will maintain its approach of not reinvesting the proceeds of maturing agency debt and payments on mortgage-backed securities held by the System Open Market Account. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
