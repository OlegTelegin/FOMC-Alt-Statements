1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1-1/2 percent.
2. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.
3. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that labor market conditions continue to improve. Although output growth has moderated in recent months, the economy appears poised to expand at a solid pace going forward absent significant further increases in energy prices.
4. Recent inflation data have been somewhat elevated, though a portion of the rise in prices evidently reflects transitory factors.
5. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal.
6. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
