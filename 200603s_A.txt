>> Alternative A 
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 4.5 percent.
2. The slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded in the current quarter, and the underlying pace of expansion appears to be solid. Resource utilization has risen further this year. Some recent data and anecdotal information suggest that the housing market is moderating, which the Committee believes will contribute to a slowing in economic growth to a more sustainable pace.
3. In addition to increases in resource utilization, the elevated prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to add to inflation pressures going forward. As yet, however, the run-up in those prices has had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have held the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained.
4. The Committee judges that maintaining the federal funds rate at its current level will likely keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.
5. Nevertheless, future policy action will be determined by the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.
