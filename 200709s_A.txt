>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 4.75 percent.
2. Tighter credit conditions and the intensification of the housing correction appear likely to exert appreciable restraint on economic growth. Moreover, the potential for significant spillovers from credit market disruptions to business and household spending poses a risk to the outlook. Today’s action is intended to help mitigate the adverse effects on the broader economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year. However, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully
4. Even after today’s action, the Committee judges that the downside risks to economic growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
