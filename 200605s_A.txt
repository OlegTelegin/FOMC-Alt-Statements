>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 4-3/4 percent.
2. Economic growth rebounded to nearly a 5 percent annual rate in the first quarter. The Committee sees growth as likely to moderate to a sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market, other lagged responses to previous rate increases, and the effects of energy price increases.
3. As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. The Committee expects core inflation to remain well contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures.
4. Against this backdrop, the Committee preferred to await additional information about economic developments before taking any further action. The Committee sees the risks to its price stability objective as slightly to the upside and judges it more likely that its next policy action will be a tightening rather than an easing.
5. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in the economic outlook, as implied by incoming information, as needed to foster its objectives of sustainable economic growth and price stability.
