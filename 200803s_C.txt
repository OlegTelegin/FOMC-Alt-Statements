1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2-3/4 percent.
2. Growth in consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to continue to weigh on economic growth. Recent policy actions should help to promote moderate growth over time, but downside risks to growth remain.
3. Inflation has been elevated, and upward pressure on inflation could result from several factors, including further increases in energy, commodity, and other import prices. Although the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, the upside risks to the outlook for inflation have increased. The Committee will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. The Committee judges that the risks to growth outweigh the risks to inflation, particularly in light of stresses in financial markets. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address the evolving risks.
