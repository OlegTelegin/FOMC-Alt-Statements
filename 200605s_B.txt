1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 percent.
2. Economic growth rebounded to nearly a 5 percent annual rate in the first quarter. The Committee sees growth as likely to moderate toward a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market, other lagged responses to previous rate increases, and the effects of energy price increases.
3. As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, and ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check. The Committee expects core inflation to remain contained. However, the recent climb in energy and other commodity prices, an apparent slight rise in inflation expectations, and possible increases in resource utilization have the potential to add to inflation pressures.
4. To keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance, some further policy firming may be needed. The Committee judges that any additional firming is likely to be modest. However, the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.
5. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.
