1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent.
2. Economic growth has moderated from its quite strong pace earlier this year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.
3. Readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months. The moderation in the growth of aggregate demand and anchored inflation expectations should help to contain inflation in coming quarters. However, the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures.
4. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to foster a moderation in inflation pressures will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
