1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 4-1/2 percent.
2. As the Committee had anticipated, economic growth appears to be slowing, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction. Although strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks and now pose greater downside risks to growth, the monetary policy actions taken earlier are expected to help promote moderate growth over time.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. The Committee views the downside risks to growth as the predominant policy concern. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
