1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2.25 percent.
2. Overall economic activity continues to expand, partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports. However, labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Nevertheless, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth.
3. Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated. Although the Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, the possibility that inflation may fail to decline as anticipated is of significant concern.
4. The Committee took this action to better balance the upside risks to inflation and the downside risks to growth. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
