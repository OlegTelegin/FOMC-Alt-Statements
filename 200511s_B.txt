1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 percent.
2. Elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity seem to have temporarily slowed the growth of spending and set back employment. However, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Spending will also be boosted by rebuilding efforts in hurricane-affected areas.
3. The cumulative rise in energy and other costs has added to inflation pressures. However, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.
4. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.
5. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
