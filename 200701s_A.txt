>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent.
2. The economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters. However, the substantial cooling of the housing market remains a drag on economic growth.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months, and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, partly reflecting the recent decline in energy prices.
4. In these circumstances, future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
