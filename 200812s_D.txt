1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.
2. Reflecting in part the intensification of the financial strains earlier in the fall, the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed further, and the near-term outlook for growth has deteriorated. Moreover, the downside risks are significant. However, policy actions taken in recent months, including reductions in short-term interest rates to very low levels, extraordinary liquidity measures, and official steps to strengthen the financial system, should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to moderate economic growth. As announced previously, the Federal Reserve will purchase a large volume of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets and thus to broader economic activity. Early next year, the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to help facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.
3. In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability.
4. In view of the large volume of reserves provided by the Federal Reserveâ€™s various liquidity facilities, the Committee recognizes that the federal funds rate is likely to average significantly below the target rate for some time. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully in light of recent policy actions and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
