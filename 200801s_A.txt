>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 2-3/4 percent.
2. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households. Moreover, recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets.
3. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting well-anchored inflation expectations, a projected leveling out of energy prices, and easing pressures on resource utilization. However, further increases in energy and commodity prices, as well as other factors, could put upward pressure on inflation. Therefore, it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
4. Todayâ€™s policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. However, downside risks to growth may well remain. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects to determine whether further action is needed to address those risks.
