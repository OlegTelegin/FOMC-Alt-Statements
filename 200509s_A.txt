>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged.
2. The Committee deferred further policy firming in light of the uncertainties surrounding the economic effects of Hurricane Katrina.
3. Output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll of the hurricane. The widespread devastation in the Gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic activity, and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production, and employment will be set back in the near term. Moreover, the disruption to the production and refining infrastructure has elevated premiums for energy products and may add to market volatility.
4. Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures. However, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.
5. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.
6. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
