>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.
2. The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity.
3. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid rate and hiring has picked up.
4. Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months presumably has been due to transitory factors.
5. The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal.
6. With underlying inflation still relatively low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.
