1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 4-3/4 percent.
2. Economic growth was solid in the third quarter despite an intensification of the housing correction. Strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance, reducing the downside risks to growth. Though incoming indicators point to some near-term slowing in the pace of economic expansion, the recent easing of monetary policy should help promote moderate growth over time.
3. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but the high level of resource utilization and recent increases in energy prices may put renewed upward pressures on overall and core inflation.
4. The Committee judges that the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.
